## ü§ñ Automation Options

### Option A: Manual Sending (Recommended for Start)

**Pros:**
- Full control over timing
- No extra setup needed
- Easy to test

**Workflow:**
1. Create client in Sanity Studio
2. Run curl command or use API tool to send welcome email
3. Monitor for intake completion, send reminder if needed
4. Schedule session, send confirmation

### Option B: Webhook Automation (Advanced)

Set up Sanity webhooks to trigger emails automatically:

1. In Sanity dashboard, go to API ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Create webhook for `client` document creation
3. Point to your API route
4. Add authentication

**Example webhook endpoint** (you'd need to create this):
```javascript
// app/api/webhooks/sanity/route.js
export async function POST(request) {
  const { _type, name, email } = await request.json()

  if (_type === 'client') {
    // Send welcome email
    await fetch('/api/emails/send-welcome', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ clientName: name, email })
    })
  }
}
```

### Option C: Scheduled Reminders (Most Advanced)

Use Vercel Cron Jobs or similar to check for incomplete tasks daily:

**Example:**
```javascript
// app/api/cron/daily-reminders/route.js
export async function GET(request) {
  // Check for clients with incomplete intake
  // Send reminders
}
```

Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/daily-reminders",
    "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
  }]
}
```

## üé® Customizing Email Templates

All templates are in `/lib/emails/`:

```
lib/
  emails/
    welcome.js
    intake-reminder.js
    contract-reminder.js
    session-confirmation.js
```

### Changing Colors

Update the purple accent (`#77599f`) in templates:
```javascript
// Before
style="background-color: #77599f;"

// After (your brand color)
style="background-color: #your-color;"
```

### Editing Copy

Templates use template literals - just edit the HTML strings:
```javascript
<p>Hi ${clientName},</p>
<p>Your custom message here...</p>
```

### Adding Your Logo

Add logo to email header:
```javascript
<img
  src="https://yourdomain.com/logo.png"
  alt="Your Logo"
  style="max-width: 200px;"
/>
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Email not configured" message

This is normal! If `RESEND_API_KEY` is not set, the API routes gracefully skip sending emails. The portal still works perfectly.

### Emails not arriving

1. **Check spam folder** - First place to look
2. **Verify FROM_EMAIL** - Must be verified domain or resend.dev
3. **Check Resend dashboard** - See delivery status
4. **Test with resend.dev** - Use Resend's test domain first

### Emails look broken

1. **Test in multiple clients** - Email rendering varies
2. **Check HTML validity** - Use online validator
3. **View in Resend dashboard** - Preview how it looks

### API route errors

```bash
# Check if Resend is installed
npm list resend

# Reinstall if needed
npm install resend

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```
